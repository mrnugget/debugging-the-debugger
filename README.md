# README

1. Open this project in VS Code
2. `cmd-shift-p` and `Debug: Restart` to start the program
3. Should see output in the `Debug Console`
4. Click the `Restart` button in the debugger

It **should** restart the process and you should see output again.

What happens for me: nothing. Output disappears. Then nothing happens. Then VS Code crashes.
